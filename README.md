## Tracking development of the app

I used a trello board to track my progress with building the features for the user stories above. It's a public board if you want to take a look - https://trello.com/b/A4glMyDh/chitter-rails. I also worked on each feature in a branch before merging the branch into main via a pull request. This was in order to replicate working in a development team and keep up the good development practices I've developed at Makers Academy.

## Deployed Heroku application
