# Chitter

A twitter clone that allows users to post messages to a public stream.

## User stories

**[View peeps](https://trello.com/c/SU5aqtBx):** ✅
```
As a... user
I want... to see peeps
So that... I can see what other people are saying
```

**[Add peeps](https://trello.com/c/MleACtGU):** ✅
```
As a... user
I want... to post a peep
So that... I can let people know what I'm doing
```

**[Order peeps by chronological order](https://trello.com/c/53MhySqI):** ✅
```
As a... user
I want... to see all peeps in reverse chronological order
So that... I can see what others are saying most recently
```

**[Display when a peep was created](https://trello.com/c/845fZKtL):** ✅
```
As a... user
I want... to see the time at which it was made
So that... I can better appreciate the context of a peep
```

**Sign up, log in & log out:** 🚧
I split this user story into two steps with two seperate trello cards:

- Step 1 - [Sign up, log in & log out](https://trello.com/c/3kxVmPyx)
- Step 2 - [Make peeps belong to a user](https://trello.com/c/qE3Lhv3Y)

```
As a... user
I want... to sign up for Chitter
So that...  I can post messages on Chitter as me
```

```
As a... user
I want... to log in to Chitter
So that...  I can post messages on Chitter as me
```

```
As a... user
I want... to log out of Chitter
So that...  someone can't post messages as me
```

**Delete peeps:**
```
As a... user
I want... to delete my own peep
So that... I can remove a peep I'm no longer happy with
```

**Update peeps:**
```
As a... user
I want... to update my own peep

```

**Comment on a peep:**
```

```

## Tracking development of the app

I used a trello board to track my progress with building the features for the user stories above. It's a public board if you want to take a look - https://trello.com/b/A4glMyDh/chitter-rails. I also worked on each feature in a branch before merging the branch into main via a pull request. This was in order to replicate working in a development team and keep up the good development practices I've developed at Makers Academy.

## Deployed Heroku application

You can view and interact with the live application via this [link](https://thawing-dusk-78531.herokuapp.com/).
